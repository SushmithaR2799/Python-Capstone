# Python Fundamentals Capstone Project

## üìù Overview
This capstone project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in **Python**, specifically focusing on **data manipulation**, **analysis**, and the application of **business logic** using real-world scenarios. The project is centered around a dataset that includes detailed employee information, project management data, and hierarchical designation levels. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the ability to clean, transform, and analyze data, all while executing complex business rules that could be directly applicable in a professional setting.

## üåü Project Highlights

- **Data Management**: Created and structured multiple dataframes from raw datasets, ensuring clean, well-organized data that was subsequently saved as CSV files for further analysis.
  
- **Missing Data Imputation**: Tackled incomplete data by computing missing values using a running average approach. This was achieved with efficient use of Python loops, demonstrating an understanding of both basic and advanced data handling techniques.
  
- **Data Transformation**: Executed key transformations including splitting columns (e.g., splitting full names into first and last names) and merging multiple dataframes into a comprehensive, unified dataset.
  
- **Business Logic Application**: Applied conditional logic to real-world scenarios, such as adjusting employee designation levels based on project success or failure, computing bonuses for successfully completed projects, and promoting employees based on tenure and age.
  
- **Advanced Operations**: Further enhanced the dataset by implementing operations such as adding title prefixes based on gender, aggregating project costs, and filtering employee records based on specific criteria.

- **Final Output**: The project culminates in a final, integrated dataframe that combines all the necessary business logic, ready to deliver actionable insights. This includes identifying key employees, understanding project management outcomes, and preparing the data for strategic decision-making.

## üõ† Technical Stack
- **Python**: Utilized for all scripting and data manipulation tasks.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Core libraries used for efficient data handling, transformation, and analysis.

## üéØ Outcome
This capstone project not only reinforces fundamental Python skills but also illustrates the application of these skills in a business context, making it a valuable addition to any data analyst or business analyst portfolio. It demonstrates readiness for tackling real-world data challenges and contributing to data-driven decision-making processes.
